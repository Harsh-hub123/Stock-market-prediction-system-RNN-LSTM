### Project Brief: Google Stock Market Prediction using LSTM

The project aims to predict future stock prices of Google using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies. This makes it suitable for analyzing time series data such as stock market trends. The project utilizes historical daily stock prices and other relevant features to train an LSTM model, which can then be used to make predictions on future stock prices.

### Working of the Project
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The historical daily stock price data is preprocessed and prepared for training by running the `data_preprocessing.py` script.
  
2. **Model Training**: An LSTM model is trained on the preprocessed data using the `model_training.py` script, and the trained model is saved as `model.h5`.
  
3. **Prediction Generation**: After training, the saved model can be used to generate predictions for future stock prices by running the `prediction.py` script.

By following these steps, users can analyze and forecast potential trends in Google's stock market based on historical data and machine learning techniques like LSTM.
